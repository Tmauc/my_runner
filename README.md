# My_runner
This project asked to make a small video game based on the rules of a finite Endless Running Game.
The basic rules for the my_runner are as follows:
• the player is a character who runs in a map you took as parameter.
• enemies and obstacles must appear on the opposite side to the player position.
• the player can use the space bar to jump and avoid obstacles and enemies.
• as the player runs, a score, which will be displayed, will increase.
• when the player dies or finishes the map, the score is displayed inside the window.
